# Motor-driver-module-DRV-8834

In this repository it is shared a simple motor driver module which could be used to control two brushed DC motors or a single stepper motor. It is smaller than the regular L293N motor driver sold online so it could fit inside smaller robots. Notice that operational maximum voltage is 11V.
